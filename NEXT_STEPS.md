# Next Steps for Bookmarks Browser Extension

## Immediate Tasks

1. **Generate Icon PNGs**: Convert the `icons/icon.svg` to PNG files at required sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128).
   - Use tools like Inkscape, GIMP, or online converters
   - Replace the placeholder empty PNG files in the `icons` directory

2. **Set up API Key**: Get an Anthropic API key and add it in the settings page:
   - Sign up at https://console.anthropic.com/ 
   - Get your API key from the console
   - Add it in the extension settings

3. **Test the Extension**:
   - Load the unpacked extension in Chrome (chrome://extensions)
   - Verify all pages load correctly
   - Test bookmark functionality and settings

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- Implement working bookmark retrieval
- Test Chrome storage synchronization
- Ensure basic grouping works

### Phase 2: User Experience
- Polish UI components
- Refine animations and transitions
- Improve responsive design

### Phase 3: Semantic Features
- Optimize semantic search performance
- Improve group generation algorithms
- Add learning from user behavior

## Known Issues to Address

1. Empty placeholder icon files need to be replaced with actual PNGs
2. Semantic features require API key configuration
3. Limited offline functionality until local semantic processing is implemented

## Additional Features to Consider

- Bookmark export/import with other browsers
- Cloud synchronization beyond Chrome's built-in sync
- Mobile companion app
- Advanced analytics and usage statistics
